# Nigiri falls - takeout application

An Android application ordered by the sushi restaurant Nigiri Falls to enable takeout from the restaurant. The application will be available for all customers with a desire to order sushi, and they can start this by choosing a relevant restaurant from one of the three possible locations: Oslo, Trondheim and Bergen. The employees of each restaurant can login to the application to review and edit different orders. 

## Get started

### Install Android studio

At the moment, the only way to run the application is through Android studio. Download Android studio here: https://developer.android.com/studio/ and install it.

### Import repository from GitLab using HTTPS
(Can also use SSH key method so you don't need to type password all the time)

1. Copy: `https://gitlab.stud.idi.ntnu.no/programvareutvikling-v19/gruppe-50.git`

2. In Android Studio: File>New>Project from Version Control>Git

3. Paste GitLab URL

4. Test

5. Choose directory you want the project in

6. Clone

**Now you should see the project files from GitLab in Android Studio**
### Add necessary file to your repository
This is only required if you need to make code changes.
*  Create a new file called `local.properties` **Not in a subfolder, just next to README.md etc.** 
*  Add this line to it `sdk.dir=/home/USER/Android/Sdk` with USER being your PC username 

### Running the application

The application can be run on an Android emulator or on an Android phone with API level 16  or higher, but the recommended API level is 28, which means Android version 9. To run the application go through the following steps:

#### Run application in emulator or on Android device

Click on run and when you get to the select target screen, either set up an emulator or connect an Android device both with API level 16 or higher (recommended is 28). Run the application on your target of choice and the application should then be running.


### How to use git with Android Studio 

We recommend using Android Studios integrated terminal when using git. You find this terminal at the bottom left of the Android Studio program. Next to **TODO** and **Version Control**. Click **Terminal**
